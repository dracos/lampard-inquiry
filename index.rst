Searchable transcripts of the Lampard Inquiry hearings
======================================================

.. note::

   The official Inquiry site can be found at
   https://www.lampardinquiry.org.uk

The Lampard Inquiry was established in 2023, led by Baroness Lampard,
to investigate mental health inpatient deaths in Essex.

This site takes a copy of the `official transcripts
<https://www.lampardinquiry.org.uk/hearings>`_, which are available
in PDF format, parses them into reStructuredText, and uploads them to
ReadTheDocs for **display and searching**.

I hope this may be useful to people following the Inquiry.
If you have any questions or comments, please do get in touch.

I have made similar sites for the `Post Office Inquiry
<https://postofficeinquiry.dracos.co.uk>`_ and the `UK Covid-19 Inquiry
<https://ukcovid19inquiry.dracos.co.uk>`_.  The code is `available on GitHub
<https://github.com/dracos/lampard-inquiry>`_ and should be adaptable to other
similar uses.
